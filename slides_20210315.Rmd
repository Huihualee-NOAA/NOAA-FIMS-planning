# why do requirements gathering?
- Requirements documentation serves as a point of reference to document the evolution of a project, its moving parts, and its implementation
- Requirements documentation serves as a blueprint for the client to better understand what to expect out of the project (the what, where, when, and why of the project).[1]

-The process of requirement gathering include identifying and documenting the necessary requirements of customers, users, stakeholders etc. related to the project. This knowledge will be used to develop solutions in the form of products, services, software etc.[2]
